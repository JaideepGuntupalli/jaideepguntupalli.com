## Overview

Mailr is a web app for sending customized emails to a large user base with CSV data. It is built to be simple and easy to use.

A web app through which you can send custom mails to a large amount users with their data as csv. You can also just send mail a single person(cus y not?). You insert their name as variable to into subject or body. You can also add attachments. When all mails are sent to the sender you will receive a report as mail about how each persons mail status.

## Why?

Sending multiple emails to individuals can be time-consuming and inefficient, as it requires manually entering each recipient's email address and sending the same message to each one. This can lead to errors in the process, such as forgetting to include a recipient or sending the wrong message. Additionally, it can be difficult to track the status of each email, such as whether it was sent or not.
