Hey everyone, this is going to be my first how-to blog. I will try my best to cover every single detail or point to a resource so that your doubts get cleared. Without any due, let's get started.

Today we will be covering how to animate a button as below using only CSS. This will be short and straightforward to implement, but before we start, I expect you to have a basic idea about HTML and CSS, like how to write basic markup and how CSS selectors work. If not, you can go through this playlist by [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4-IK0AVhVjM0xE0K2uZRvsM7LkIhsPT-).

## HTML

We need to add a button in the body in your index.html file, as shown below.

If you aren't on a CodePen, you will need to link your stylesheet section. I will use the Montserrat font family to style the text in the button, and I got it from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com). You can use your favorite font from Google fonts but don't forget to include the required lines in the section.

## CSS

Let's now start CSS for this.

### Body

First, let's add the background color and font family by selecting the whole body. We can use either the `background` or `background-color` property to set the color for the background. I randomly chose a theme from [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) and used `#ffe8d6` as the background color. For the Font family, we will use `font-family` property to set the font to `Montserrat`, and we will add `sans-serif` as the fallback font.

We will also center the button for more visibility using the `display` property set to `flex`. If you have no experience using flexbox, you can ignore these for now, or check out this 15 min video by [Web Dev Simplified](https://youtu.be/fYq5PXgSsbE) for understanding. It is going to be a bit tricky at the start and to get the hang of it.

### Button Rest state

Now let's get to styling the button. First, let's remove that ugly background by setting `background` property to `none` or `transparent`. Then, increase the `font-size` to `large` for visibility and put the `font-weight` to `800`. Set the `color` property to `#6b705c`, which sets the font color. Let's make font to all CAPS by setting `text-transform` property to `uppercase`. Now let's add some padding and border to the button, as shown below.

### Button Hover state

We have now coded the rest state of the button. Let's now code the hover state of the button.

For this, we will use a [pseudo-class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) called [hover](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:hover). Hover Styles can be applied for an element by adding `:hover` syntax to the end of the selector.

We will be changing the background to a darker color to intimate the selection. We will use `#6b705c` as the background to the button. We will also change the font's color using `color` property to `#ffe8d6`(a lighter shade) to make it readable. We will add a `border-radius` to create rounded corners for the button. You can keep or remove the `border`. But I removed it so that it would give a cleaner animation. We will now shift the button up a bit to give the feeling of the lift. We will do this using the `transform`property and set it to `translateY(-5px)`. We will also add shadow using `box-shadow`property. For more details, check out this MDN page about [box-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow). We will also set the `cursor` to the `pointer` to show the hand symbol instead of the arrow we get.

### Button Transitions

Now the before and hover styles are done but, it is too snappy. So we will add some transitions to make it smooth and satisfying.

We will use the transition property to set the timings and time functions. For more details, check out this [page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition) from MDN.

Now it should look pretty good and snappy. If you have any doubts, check out my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/gj_deep/pen/yLzNNxj) of the above tutorial, so you can play around with the timings and colors to make your own.
